# GMIT-project-2018-programming-scripting
Project 2018 for crn 52167 Programming &amp; Scripting. Student **G00219132 SHUDSON**

The project centres around Fisher's [Iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) 

Prior to this my only experience of Iris was as my requested seasonal flower in my wedding bouquet.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to contain the dataset, scripts and notes relating to the project 

## Personal Goals 
Much of my day to day work involves data, whilst reasonably proficient in database interrogation and in the use of excel I am not always sure how to analyse and display different data in a MEANINGFUL way. I am hoping that what I learn during this module/project can be used and expanded upon in my daily work. 

## Compilation
python was used for all programming tasks in this programme.
