# GMIT-project-2018-programming-scripting #
Project 2018 for crn 52167 Programming &amp; Scripting. Student **G00219132 SHUDSON**

## Purpose ##
This repository contains the Project of Student **G00219132, Susan Hudson** for module Programming and Scripting. The module is delivered as part of the [Higher Diploma in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/computing/higher-diploma-science-computing-data-analytics-ict-skills) in GMIT.
It contain the dataset, scripts and notes relating to the project

The project centres around Fisher's [Iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) 

Prior to this my only experience of Iris was as my requested seasonal flower in my wedding bouquet!

# Project Scope #
Wilst the project brief outlined clearly the project minimum requirements the Project Scope was not dictated. Following an initial period of exploration of the dataset I decided to scope in line with personal goals as outlined below. I therefore decided to use similar analysis to work tasks that I would normally perform in Excel/SQL such as group by statistics, plots and outputting of results to files. 
* General statistics on entire dataset.
* Statistics at species level. 
* Produce some graphs and learn how to save these.
* Learn how to save output of statistics to file.
* As this is a new course and I have an interest in student retention I decided to also document within the 'readme' personal goals, challenges and lessons learned. 

## Personal Goals ##
Much of my day to day work involves data, whilst reasonably proficient in database interrogation and in the use of excel I am not always sure how to analyse and display different data in a MEANINGFUL way. I am hoping that what I learn during this module/project can be used and expanded upon in my daily work. 
Embarking on further education was one of a series of personal goals/challenges I set myself to mark my half century milestone. 
When researching courses this course (https://www.gmit.ie/computing/higher-diploma-science-computing-data-analytics-ict-skills)it ticked a good many of my requirement boxes, interesting, relevant, cheap and potentially useful from a career progression perspective. 

## Challenges & Lessons Learned ##
* Broadband speed was an initial challenge as I was unable to download content to watch offline and had poor home BB. Luck intervened with the timely rollout of High Speed Broadband to my rural location in January.  
* Freeing up enough time to devote to the programming and scripting module proved difficult as it is not a subject that I could dip in and out of for 20 or 30 minutes and I found I needed at least two hours at a time to immerse myself in the module. I eventually found my best working method which was to watch the videos on my PC whilst attempting the examples on a laptop and then making relevant notes. Then and only then did I attempt weekly tasks! 
* Changed way of learning â€“ in past study life all contact was in a classroom/lab environment and the online environment has its challenges as it was easy to get bogged down on small problems which in a classroom environment would have been solved quickly by consulting with peers/academics. I found the concept of discussion boards and google slightly alien and potentially overwhelming. 
* Day to day life and work responsibilities interrupted a few times and I found myself unable to engage in both modules simultaneously, after some initial panic I decided to divert my time fully to whichever of the modules needed it most until these external factors calmed down. 


## Code language ##
All coding is [Python 3.6.5](https://www.python.org/)
