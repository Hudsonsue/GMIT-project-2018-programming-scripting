## Personal Goals 
Much of my day to day work involves data, whilst reasonably proficient in database interrogation and in the use of excel I am not always sure how to analyse and display different data in a MEANINGFUL way. I am hoping that what I learn during this module/project can be used and expanded upon in my daily work. 

## Code language ##
All coding is [Python 3.6.5](https://www.python.org/)
